SUMMARY                                         *dir*

By default Vim is delivered with |netrw| plugin, which is bloated, unintuitive
and buggy.  Hence the |dir|.

|dir| is a simple directory browser, that uses the same principles as normal Vim
buffer.  In fact it does use the dedicated Vim buffer with specific |dir|
filetype.  Inspired by vim-vinegar plugin
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar).

INTERFACE                                       *dir-interface*

                                                *:Dir*
:Dir {directory}        Open {directory} in current window.  Suppress if the
                        buffer in the current window is modified.

                                                *:Dir!*
:Dir! {directory}       Open {directory} in current window.  Ignore the buffer
                        in current window.

                                                *:Sir*
:Sir {directory}        Open {directory} in horizontal split.

                                                *:Sir!*
:Sir! {directory}       Open {directory} in horizontal split.

                                                *:Vir*
:Vir {directory}        Open {directory} in vertical split.

                                                *:Sir!*
:Vir! {directory}       Open {directory} in vertical split.

FILE TYPE                                       *dir-filetype*

The |dir| filetype is a simple syntax consisting of three different items:

  Highlight       Example                    Explanation ~
  |dirHeader|       [/home/placek/projects]    The header of the |dir| file.  The
                                             path of the directory.
  |dirDirectory|    some_dir/                  The subdirectory.
  |dirFile|         some_file                  The file.

MAPPING                                         *dir-mapping*

The |dir-filetype| has some mappings of its own:

                                                *h* *<left>*
h           or
<left>                Move up the directory.

                                                *l* *<right>* *<cr>*
l           or
<right>     or
<cr>                  Change directory to the subdirectory under the cursor or
                      edit a file under the cursor.

                                                *.*
.                     Toggle |dir_filtering|.

FILTERING                                       *dir-filtering*

|dir| is using simple, regex-based filtering.  The pattern is checked against
the file or dir name and if it match, then it is rendered.

                                                *g:dir_filter*
The pattern can be set with the global variable:
>
>
        let g:dir_filter   = '^[^\.].*'
<
                                                *g:dir_filtered*

The filtering can be turned off by default by setting a global variable:
>
        let g:dir_filtered = 1
<
